              Starting as a funny joke on random stormy night, Popping Potatoes was born from two college students love for spuds. The idea was that you could use potatoes in any dish so why not build a restaurant with potatoes as the main ingredient in every meal. Its a super delicous and versitile food that is enjoyed everywhere in the world. Many different chefs and food connoisseur have all come together to help build our famous menu. We have everything from potatoes sliced into curly fries all the way to a classic Baked potatoe. If you have a love for food and can appreciate a good spud, come see us at Popping Potatoes Bar & Grill.
